Description:
This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script. However, the password is long and complex, 
and Sam is often forgetful. So he wrote a script that would email his password to him automatically in 
case he forgot. Here is the script:
From <https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/4/> 
This time we get a button that calls a function, the function sends Sam's email the password.
By using Burp Suite or changing the value of the email with DEV TOOLS, we can send to password to our 
email instead of Sam's.
The email stats:
Sam,
Here is the password: '99193ab8'.
